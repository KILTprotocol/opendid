# OpenDID

OpenDID is an OpenID Provider implementation capable of authenticating users through their Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credentials.

It implements the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Introduction)
and acts as a bridge between the decentralized identity world and the centralized authentication world supporting both
the implicit and Authorization Code Flow.
